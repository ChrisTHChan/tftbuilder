A team comp building app for the game teamfight tactics

https://tftcompbuilder.herokuapp.com/

You can add items and champions by dragging the respective image of what you want over to the hex you want it in. You can also remove champions by moving them from the hex their currently residing in to the list on the right.
Under the notes section you can look to add specific informative tid-bits about the team composition you are creating, so that when you get into game you can remind yourself about what you need to do to succeed.
Once you are done, you can go to the comps tab to save your current composition, as well as view and delete other compositions you have already built. Your comps will still be here even when you leave the site, so don't worry about losing them!
This tool can be used to consolidate all the information you find on other sites about all the current meta compositions, so that you can have all the information you need during your game in one convenient spot, no matter what items or champions you're given. You can also build upon comps that you've already saved! Please enjoy this tool, and I hope you find great use with it!
